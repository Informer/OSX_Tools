OSX_Tools
=========

This is a script that changes your wallpaper based on its tag.


You will NEED 2 other things to run this script.

1. This is a very simple first iteration that assumes that the images that
you want to use are tagged ”wallpaper”.

2. That you have Tags installed. This is a very small commandline tool for reading Mac OSX
	tags.


	Find it here https://github.com/jdberry/tag	
	
	To install use your commandline / Terminal using either the Homebrew or MacPorts package manager (its just easier)
	
	
	Just type or copy and paste one of the options below.
	
	
	** MacPorts **

	sudo port install tag
	
	** Homebrew **

	brew install tag 


///***************************************    Usage     *************************************************************////

Download geektool and pass the following into the command field in geektool's preferences.

'osascript ~/Replace with Your Folder/wallpaper_tags.scpt'


alternatively download the script from here and double click every time you would like to run it.


A future update will include a mac status bar app that allows the user
to pick their tag and the desktop will update accordingly
